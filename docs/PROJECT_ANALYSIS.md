- ✅ Stripe integration tables with proper relationships
- ✅ Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
- ✅ Enum types for status management
- ✅ Secure views for user data access

**Missing Tables:**
- ❌ Users table (relies on auth.users)
- ❌ Video projects table
- ❌ Clip segments table
- ❌ Transcript segments table
- ❌ Analytics events table
- ❌ User feedback table
- ❌ Prediction parameters table

## Critical Issues & Gaps
